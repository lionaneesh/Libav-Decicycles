Libav-Decicycles
================

Libav-Decicycles is a bash script written for the libav (http://libav.org/) developers which inputs a command (giving out decicycles), runs it 'count' number of times, parses the values, adds them up and gives out an average. 

'n' can be increased upto a finite limit to increase the accuracy.
Note: You need to add START_TIMER/STOP_TIMER around the code you are testing.

Example
=======

>> bash time.sh ./avconv -cpuflags sse2 -i /Users/aneeshdogra/Movies/FATE/lossless-audio/inside.tta -f crc -
Average Decicycles : 434452
